# Image-Recognition-Master-Thesis
My master thesis about Image recognition in Tensorflow.

Algorithm for image recognition from my master's thesis. It is a part of whole project with the purpose of recognition and detection of anmial species that are close to the road. All those methods were implemented to recognise animal and warn the driver by sending light signal from road posts or send it to aplications such as Google Maps or Apple Maps. 

I used Tensorflow and Keras libraries with premade Inception V3 model, pandas and numpy for data operations, 
matplotlib for data viz, images were taken from kaggle.com portal.

Final output of the model was almost 96% of accuracy which means that from 100 images 96 were recognized correctly which is a high score.
